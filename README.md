Freedom Fighters - A space shooter written in C for DOS.

## What is this?

This is a very old DOS game written in Borland C++ (circa 2001).
It's a space shooter, somewhat similar to Tyrian 2000 (except much more basic).

It is quite poorly written, while studying computer science in highschool, before the days of the internet, and unlikely to be easy to compile nowadays.

The functionality relied on a Vesa driver. And the performance was very poor to begin with (due to the used drawing technique).

## How do I compile it ?

I'm not certain anymore, but hopefully, I'll create a remake of the game.
The original code was compiled and build using some Borland C++ DOS version, 
I don't really know which of the versions was the correct one, as the built executable was based on the compiled file, and I don't recall which was the `correct` main one: FF2.cpp or FIX.CPP.

## Wait, is this FF2? Where is FF1?

FF1 was just some (failed) experiment. You see, FF2 is the 2nd attempt at such a game.

## Why Freedom Fighters?

Because they are fighters. And they fight freedom!
(Or was it FOR freedom? I don't recall.)
